  3. Complete the deletion by running the command: git rm file1.txt
  4. Commit the staged changes by running the command: git commit -m "deleted"

Step 4: Unstaging a Deleted File
  1. Delete file2.txt in your working directory by running the command: rm file2.txt
  2. Stage the deletion by running the command: git add .
